### A little explanation 

1. I used Panels & Panels Everywhere instead of Demonstrate block Regions because of custom theme, there are a lot of ways in
Drupal for creating websites so I choose this method. this one is kind of my favorite.

2. created a content type and views for events instead of static block. so it will dynamic. New and upcoming event will be shown on
front page dynamically.

2. Used date module for event dates.

4. Created a new content type for members so it will be easy for a user to add their new member. it will show dynamically in the row.
